		<p> A series of two handmade books documenting an eight month long project on the discrimination against racial, gender and class differences. The books explore personal encounters with these issues, critiques of the retinaia, an analysis of historical protests and design's role throughout these moments of social controversy. Compositions are created by juxtaposing the essence of non-human vs human elements. They are honest, exciting and debatable critiques of modern society that beg to ask, what divides us and unites us?
<!-- 
		Throughout the project, many questions are left unanswered as they are indefinite and at times, too abstract. The curiosity is, what divides us and unites us?  -->

		<!--  What does it mean to be a woman? What does it mean to be a man? Why does the surface color of skin segregate communities? Why do we not treat each other as humans? --> </p>

	<p> We are the Others. <br> We want to end the stigma around our differences. We came to clarify, we are not different, we are real. We will stay true to ourselves no matter how inadequate you may think we are. We want to end the ideals for whiteness, slimness, perfectness and richness because that's not what we aspire to be. We want the retinaia to go fuck itself. We want real representations of who we are. We want truth. We will not teach our chilren how to discriminate because we want a society of love + fairness. We want a society that brings us together instead of one that tears us apart. We want to make it loud and clear that we will not fix ourselves to fit in and reach these false standards. We will remain who we are. We want to stop being separated by differences of race, gender and wealth. We refuse to "stay in our place" and will smash these systems of oppression. We will not tolerate living in hatred and abuse. We want to be treated like human beings. We want to be free. </p>
